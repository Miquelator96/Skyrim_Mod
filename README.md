# Skyrim_Mod
Code used for my Dynamic NPC in Skyrim mod project. It uses the Papyrus language, an object-oriented code used in Bethesda's Creation Kit software.

This project's goal is to improve combat variation and replayability in long playthroughs of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim game by implementing a nigh-immortal enemy that will harrass the player. Gradually he will acquire traits designed to counter the player's preference towards melee combat or ranged combat, depending on where he allocated his skill points.
One of the main difficulties and interesting points of this project was usign Creation Kit's Papyrus API, which was unknown to me and designed specifically for this game's needs. The fact that I was able to create a new mechanic using an existing API and which derived into a playtested improved experience was a big success for me.
